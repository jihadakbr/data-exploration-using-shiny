# Data Exploration Using Shiny Dashboard

The primary business objective for Rakamin Academy is to identify opportunities for scaling up strategy and planning, with a specific focus on analyzing the Virtual Project-Based Internship (PBI) product. To achieve this goal, I aim to accomplish the following objectives: Firstly, I will seek to discern patterns in user purchase behavior related to the PBI product. Secondly, I intend to gain insights into customer distribution based on their geographical location, among other factors. Lastly, I aim to measure and optimize the lead time from the initial contact with potential customers until they make a payment, enhancing the efficiency of our sales process. These objectives will guide my efforts in maximizing the potential of the PBI product and driving growth for Rakamin Academy.
